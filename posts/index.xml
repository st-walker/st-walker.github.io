            <description>Overview A set of benchmarks for the study of the proposed eSASE chicane in the EUXFEL. It is important to understand how the beam may be degrade due CSR in the chicane, and whether or not the optical configuration by introducing β-function waist in the fourth dipole. If CSR degradation in the chicane even with the existing FODO optics is tolerable then all is well.

<h2 id="initial-distribution">Initial distribution</h2>
<p>As stated above the intention is to study two sets of optics, standard FODO optics and
optimised optics.  The FODO optics are shown below.  All simulations below are run using
these exact optics.  I have yet to do a more optimal one.</p>
<p><img src="/esase/optics-sub-optimal.pdf" alt="fodo-optics" title="FODO optics in the eSASE chicane"></p>
<p>The projected slice lengths for this configuration are below, and it can be seen that
the projected slice lengths are small compared with the bunch length above (~20µm).  The
projected lengths were derived using the equation stated in <a href="https://www.desy.de/fel-beam/data/talks/papers/impact_of_optics_2005.pdf">this
paper</a>.  The
waist s<sub>w</sub> is equal to 0 in this configuration, leading to a relation that is
dominated by the R<sub>51</sub> due to the small angle (R<sub>56</sub>), which is
equivalent in magnitude on both sides of the chicane.  The acumulated R<sub>51</sub> and
R<sub>52</sub> through the chicane are shown.  However the lengths are comparable in
length to that of the final eSASE spike (100nm).</p>
<p><img src="/esase/sigma_proj-r51-r52.pdf" alt="projected-slice-length"></p>
<p>The input distribution (without energy modulation) is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/esase/esase-primary.pdf" alt="esase-primary" title="Input distribution without chirp"></p>
<p>The energy modulation with the longitudinal beam profile
overlaid is shown below.  The width of the central peak&rsquo;s linear part is about 0.2µm,
giving a linear chirp of about 5455m<sup>-1</sup>.  For maximal compression, this corresponds to
an R<sub>56</sub> of -1/5455m<sup>-1</sup> = -190.5µm.</p>

<h1 id="tracking-without-any-csr">Tracking without any CSR</h1>
<p>First it is useful to examine the compression without any collective effects to ensure
that the beam and chicane are implemented correctly.  Shown below are the beam
distributions before and after the chicane.  The chicane and the chirp bring the peak
current to nearly 20kA, as expected.</p>

<h1 id="tracking-with-csr-but-without-energy-modulation">Tracking with CSR but without energy modulation</h1>
<p>To simply study the impact of CSR on a bunch of this length in the given chicane, I
simulated without any compression.  There is a slight deformation in the bunch slice
positions shown in the top right, but no growth in the slice or projected emittances at
all.</p>

<h1 id="tracking-with-csr">Tracking with CSR</h1>
<p>As the chicane and input beam distributions seem to be working correctly, now to include
CSR effects.</p>
<h3 id="tuning-simulation-parameters">Tuning simulation parameters</h3>
<p>In GPT I set the <code>accuracy</code> (number of decimal places in γβ) to 6, which is
the same as used for the Zeuthen benchmark.</p>
<p>In OCELOT there are a number that must be adjusted to ensure physical results.  The two
most pertinent are <code>unit_step</code> of the <code>Navigator</code> class and <code>sigma_min</code> of the <code>CSR</code>
class.  As I understand it, <code>unit_step</code> must be set sufficiently small to ensure that
the Navigator doesn&rsquo;t take very large steps (otherwise the backtracking employed when
calculating the CSR wake will be wrong, as it uses the rigid beam approximation I
think), and <code>sigma_min</code> must sufficiently small to not smooth out any small details (but
not so small that one will see artificial microbunching).  The central spike goes down
to about 100nm in length, so I chose a value of <code>sigma_min</code> of 10nm (one tenth the beam
size or the length of some feature of interest is the rule of thumb I used).  The
<code>unit_step</code> I set to 1 cm on the basis of convergence studies I performed for the
Zeuthen benchmark, but obviously this is a different chicane so this could indeed be
wrong here.</p>
<p>For CSRTrack (1D) I used a <code>sigma_long</code> of 10nm, using the same reasoning
as for <code>sigma_min</code> in OCELOT.  The rest of the CSRTrack tracking configuration:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  track_step{precondition=yes
             iterative=2
             error_per_ct=0.001
             error_weight_momentum=0.0

             ct_step_min=0.02
             ct_step_max=0.10
             ct_step_first=0.10
             increase_factor=1.5
             arc_factor=0.3
             duty_steps=yes
            }
</code></pre><h2 id="ocelot-csr">OCELOT CSR</h2>
<p>No impact on the slice or projected emittances can be seen.  The different post-chicane peak current
shown here to OCELOT tracking without CSR is generally because the peak current is
sensitive to the initial seed for some reason.</p>

<h2 id="gpt-csr">GPT CSR</h2>

<h2 id="csrtrack-csr">CSRTrack CSR</h2>
<p><img src="/esase/CSRtrack-output.pdf" alt="csrtrack-esase-with-csr" title="CSRTrack befor and after CSR"></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Contrary to my own expectations, CSR seems to have little impact on the projected or
slice emittances.  This is most likely due to the minimal longitudinal mixing,
ultimately stemming from the small bending angle and smaller geometric emittance.</p>
